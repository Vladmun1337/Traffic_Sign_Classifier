# Traffic Sign Recognition with CNN

For this project I have decided to classify a dataset of 877 images in 4 categories of traffic signs:
- trafficlight
- crosswalk
- stop
- speedlimit

The scope of the project was to further my understanding of Convolutional Neural Networks and practice my data handling skills. I hope you enjoy my project, for the step-by-step explanation and implementation see the `traffic.ipynb` notebook
:)
